  This is an implementation of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/private-events#project-private-events">Private Events </a>
  project in the ruby pathway of the odin project. The task was to build a site that allows users to create and join events, a bonus being allowing the creation of private events and making invites
  for these type of events and the site allows this both.
